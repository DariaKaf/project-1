# Project 1 with Genereal Assembly: Vanilla Javascript game.

## Intro
A 7 day solo project to create a single page game using vanilla Javascript. This was the first project as part of the General Assembly Full-Stack course, following 4 weeks of learning.

### Game brief and requirements
* The game should be playable for one player.
* The obstacles should be auto generated.

The idea of a Frogger type game is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.

## Technologies used: 
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Git & GitHub
* Procreate
* GIMP

## The game: "Get to the pub"

So much has happened during 2020-2021, and you’re so close to putting it behind you forever.

### Challenges
The main challanges have been detecting collision between objects and managing the different timersfor each object, as well as the game scre and reset functions.

### Known issues
* Car objects are 'stuck' at the end of the screen instead of clearing.
* Movement for guy on skateboard is wrong and should be going back and forth.

### Future features
* Cars followed by more cars
* Additional danger of collision sprites, such as floating viruses, animals, more people, etc., to make game world feel more full.
* Replace entire game background with nicer art, and make pub end goal more clear and appealing.
* Add a start button to run the game.
