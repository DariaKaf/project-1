### Game brief and requirements
* The game should be playable for one player.
* The obstacles should be auto generated.

The idea of a Frogger type game is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.


### Challenges
The main difficulty here is animating the obstacles and detecting collision. 
There will be a number of timers to manage across the whole game, which can be easily get out of hand.
